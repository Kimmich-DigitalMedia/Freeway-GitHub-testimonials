===========================

It's a test - nothing more - to get the gist.

The Stone Oven Project is to be seen as a template or a current stat snapshot of an upcoming template.
In this Git are all necessary files included.

The Preview of the Template can be found at:

http://kimmich-dm.de/templates/stoneoven/index.html

In my screencasts I'll re-use this file as a referral - so you're free to grab the current stat.

The screencasts are mainly exclusive in a subscription area, but some are even free. You can find them on:

http://www.kimmich-dm.de/wordpress/?cat=10 (from new to old).

So simply said:

My subscribers will anyway learn how to build this.

Cheers

Thomas
